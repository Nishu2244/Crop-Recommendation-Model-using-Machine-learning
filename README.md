# Crop-Recommendation-Model-using-Machine-learning
A machine learning approach to predict the crop by checking the quality of soil.
It uses Logistic Regression to predict crops based on the following 7 input parameters.

 Rainfall,
 Humidity,
 pH value,
 Temperature,
 Phosphorous(K),
 Nitrogen(N) and
 Potassium(P)
 
The N-P-K values are ratio between Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium. This means if soil contains 3% nitrogen (N), 2% phosphorus (P) and 5% potassium (K) then its NPK value is 3-2-5.
